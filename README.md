# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover hidden trends
We looked at thousands of crowdfunding projects to identify trends## Analysis and Challenges---We compared successful versus failed campaigns, looked at various metrics for each including goal, amount pledged, date of launch. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The most successful months to launch were April through July with the least successful launches in December, possibly due to the holidays. May had the most successful launches. ![Outcomes Based on Launch Date Line Graph with Markers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89313168/134093372-b77f6967-dace-4c34-88c3-6a368f5cd560.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Failed Kickstarter campaigns had much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. The average goal of failed campaigns was close to double that of successful campaigns. ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89313168/134093616-00ca7607-8369-43a1-a722-e7e9adec103c.png)


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the challenges a student might encounter are learning how to use the various functions in excel to get the desired result as well as how to go back to correct any mistakes made. It was challenging for me to understand the statistical concepts because the functions and formulas were new to me. 

## Results
Successful campaigns have a lower goal then failed campaigns. The average goal for successful campaigns was $4000.  The best months to launch a campaign are April through July. The worst month to launch is December. One limitation of the data set is that it does not include the amount of money spent on marketing and promotion for each campaign. Suggested tables and/or graphs might include comparing the success rate by year to identify trends over the time spanned by the dataset.
